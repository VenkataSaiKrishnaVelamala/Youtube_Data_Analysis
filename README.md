# Youtube_Data_Analysis

The YouTube Data Analysis project fused the YouTube API with AWS and Tableau, aiming to equip content creators with actionable insights rooted in engagement metrics for content development.

Leveraging the YouTube API, the project systematically gathered and processed extensive video performance data encompassing views, likes, comments, shares, and audience demographics. AWS functioned as the backbone, managing data storage, processing, and analysis tasks. AWS services like S3 for storage, Glue for ETL processes, and Redshift for data warehousing efficiently handled the substantial volume of YouTube data.

Tableau, the visualization tool, played a pivotal role by presenting detailed dashboards and reports. These visualizations showcased engagement metrics in a user-friendly format, enabling content creators to discern trends, favored content themes, and audience preferences.

This data-driven approach empowered content creators to make informed decisions about video types, topics, and formats resonating most with their audience. Insights on audience demographics facilitated tailored content strategies, optimizing engagement and viewership.

The ultimate project goal was to arm content creators with insights and tools for refining content creation strategies, fostering improved audience engagement, and nurturing a dedicated and engaged viewer base.
